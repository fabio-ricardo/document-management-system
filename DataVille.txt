1. Problem Breakdown: DataVille needs a solution to reduce traffic congestion using its existing traffic cameras and limited resources. The main challenges are the modest budget, limited cloud capacity, and no room for big infrastructure changes. However, the available cameras and a scalable approach offer a good starting point to build an effective system.

2. Solution Design: The solution is to use existing traffic cameras integrated with edge devices, like Raspberry Pi or Arduino, to collect and preprocess real-time data, reducing the load on cloud resources. The devices will extract key metrics like vehicle count and queue length using computer vision, while the cloud system aggregates and analyzes this data to identify patterns and predict congestion. 

A central algorithm to traffic light timings dynamically, starting with simple rule-based logic (e.g., extending green lights for heavy traffic) and evolving into AI-driven optimization for predictive management. As a starting point, historical data could also be used to train the AI model, so the adaptation time is shorter. A dashboard allows city officials to monitor traffic, visualize issues, and manually override settings as needed. This approach balances cost, efficiency, and scalability.

3. Prioritization: The focus should be on integrating cameras with edge devices and setting up a simple traffic light adjustment system. Preprocessing data locally minimizes cloud dependency, and a basic algorithm to adjust lights based on vehicle counts can deliver quick results. These steps provide immediate value while staying within budget.

4. Evolution Plan: In the short term, adding AI for predictive traffic management and expanding edge computing to more intersections will improve the system. Later, incorporating GPS or other sensor data and scaling cloud resources can enhance capabilities further. This gradual approach ensures growth as resources become available.

5. Critical Challenges: Key challenges include protecting data privacy and managing limited resources. Data anonymization and efficient cloud usage are essential. Regular monitoring and gradual scaling will address these risks while keeping the system reliable and cost-effective.
