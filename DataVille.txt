1. Problem Breakdown: DataVille needs a solution to reduce traffic congestion using existing traffic cameras and limited resources. The main challenges are the short budget, limited cloud capacity, and no room for big infrastructure changes. However, the available cameras and a scalable approach offer a good starting point to build an effective system.

2. Solution Design: Existing traffic cameras could be used in combination with edge devices (like Raspberry Pi or Arduino), to collect and preprocess real-time data to reduce the load on cloud resources. The devices will extract key metrics such as vehicle count and queue length through the use of computer vision, while the cloud system aggregates and analyzes this data for identifying patterns and forecasting congestion.

There would be a central algorithm to time the traffic lights dynamically, starting with simple rule-based logic (e.g., extend green lights for heavy traffic) and evolving into AI-driven optimization for predictable management. For this, AI could use historical incident data also to train the model at the start, so adaptation time is shorter. A dashboard would allow city officials to see traffic, visualize issues, and manually override settings as needed. This approach leads to a balance between costs, efficiency, and scalability.

3. Prioritization: The focus should be on integrating cameras with edge devices and setting up a simple traffic light adjustment system. Preprocessing data locally minimizes cloud dependency, and a basic algorithm to adjust lights based on vehicle count can deliver quick results. These steps serve to get immediate value within the budget.

4. Evolution Plan: Adding AI for predictive traffic management and expanding edge computing to more intersections will improve the system. Later, incorporating GPS or other sensor data and scaling cloud resources can enhance capabilities further

5. Critical Challenges: Key challenges include protecting data privacy and managing limited resources. Data anonymization and efficient cloud usage are essential. Regular monitoring and gradual scaling will address these risks while keeping the system reliable and cost-effective.
