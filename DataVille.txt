1. Problem Breakdown: the city needs a solution to reduce traffic jam by using existing traffic cameras and limited resources. The main challenges are the short budget, limited cloud capacity, and no room for big infrastructure changes. The available cameras and a scalable approach are a good starting point to build an automated system.

2. Solution Design: Existing traffic cameras could be used in combination with edge devices (like Raspberry Pi or Arduino), to collect and preprocess real-time data to reduce the load on cloud resources. The devices will extract key metrics such as vehicle count and queue length through the use of computer vision, while the cloud system aggregates and analyzes this data for identifying patterns and predicting congestion.

There would be a central algorithm to time the traffic lights dynamically, starting with simple rule-based logic (e.g., extend green lights for heavy traffic) and evolving into AI-driven optimization for predicion management. For this, AI could use historical data also to train the model at the start, so adaptation time is shorter. A dashboard would also be created so analysts could see traffic, visualize issues, or manually override settings, if needed. 

3. Prioritization: The focus should be on integrating cameras with edge devices and setting up a simple traffic light adjustment system. Preprocessing data locally reduces cloud dependency, and a basic algorithm to adjust lights based on vehicle count can deliver quick and effective results. 

4. Evolution Plan: Adding AI to predict traffic and and expanding edge devices to more intersections will improve the system. In the long term, incorporating GPS or other sensor data, and scaling cloud resources could improve the system.

5. Critical Challenges: Protecting data privacy by using data anonymization and managing cloud usage effectively. In order to address those issues, regular monitoring and gradual scaling will keep the system reliable and cost-effective.
